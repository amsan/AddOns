Pick up LPS changes


--------------------

Rainrider:
	- Travis: move the build to Ubuntu Trusty
	This resolves the issue with luabitop.
	-y argument is needed.
	Erlang has problem on travis' new infrastructure, that's why the switch
	to C
	- Fix travis CI
	Also added a gitter.im webhook
myth384:
	- Changed invert to highlight
	Coloured borders are called highlights everywhere in the code. So, I
	think this is the most logical wording for showing missing auras with
	coloured borders.
Rainrider:
	- Some small changes to missing auras highlights for consistency
myth384:
	- Fix for highlight texture after masque toggle
	After selecting a non default texture, toggling the Masque button on and
	off resulted in showing the default texture.
	- Fix for disabling texture selection box
	When enabling Masque support the texture selection box did not get
	disabled previously.
	- Fix for overlay size
	After unticking the masque toggle, selecting a different overlay texture
	resulted in oversized overlays.
	- Added additional methods for showing missing Auras; as a hint or a flash. Changed configuration options for spells. The inverted toggle was removed. A dropdown list for selecting the method for missing auras was added instead. This includes none, inverted, hint and flash. Added logic for the promote toggle to be only applicable for the none and inverted methods. I doesn't make sense for the hint and flash methods. Added some code to upgrade saved variables.
	- A quick change to get tests working
	- A quick change to get tests working
