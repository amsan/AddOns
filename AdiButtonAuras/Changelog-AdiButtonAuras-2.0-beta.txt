First Legion Beta

Just tagging for a working pre-patch version.
No special rules yet, mostly just LPS import.
See https://github.com/AdiAddons/AdiButtonAuras/issues/209


--------------------

Rainrider:
	- Update links to DRData
	DRData-1.0 is not hosted on wowace anymore so it has to be embedded.
	- Remove raid buffs from common rules
	- Add LibArtifactData-1.0 dependency
	- Remove all custom rules for a clean start
	- Add the demon hunter class
	- items: fix consumables detection
	- common: comment out some of the removed spells
	- Don't load Items.lua for now
	GetAuctionItemClasses is gone in Legion
	TODO look for replacement
